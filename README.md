# DA204E (Spring 25) - [Programming in C#](https://mau.se/en/study-education/course/da204e) @ [MAU](https://mau.se/en/)
This is an introductory course to programming in C#. In this course we are learning C# with simple OOP principles and Windows Forms / GUI application development. The course consists of multiple assignments grouped into two groups as far as grading goes along with two quizzes graded together.

## Structure
This repo contains all the assignments I've worked on along with a some smaller optional projects on the side. Each assignment is in its own folder.


## About assignments

### Assignment 1 (A1A, A1B) - Exploring classes
Basically just some very simple OOP building our first classes and using encapsulation as a concept. Just some small terminal applications, nothing special really.

### Assignment 2 (A2A, A2B, A2C, A2D) - Loops, string formatting and basic calculation
Assignment two involves four parts: A2A - CostCalculator, A2B - NumberGame, A2C - StringFunctions / TemperatureConverter, A2D - Scheduler.
During all the parts of the assignments I've been tasked to validate input and use loops to let the user rerun the program without having to start it again. Additionally I've worked with formatting strings.

#### A2A
Calculates discounts based on the amount of units the user decides to buy.

#### A2B
Lets the user guess a number. There are multiple difficulties which limit the amount of guesses the user can make.

#### A2C
Consists of using some very simple built-in methods for strings like ToUpper(). It also consists of a temperature converter than prints out a conversion table in a neat format.

#### A2D
More or less the same as A2C but without the conversion calculation, I use a for loop and some very basic math to determine which weeks the user is working.

### Assignment 3V2 (V2 is for grades B and A)
This assignment tackles the use of Windows Forms for making a GUI. The program involves calculating the recommended daily water intake for a person based on data provided in text boxes, radio buttons and combo boxes.
Additionally the second part of the application is a retirement savings calculator. Throughout the assignment there has been a focus on using enums and validation. Though the UX is not the best with popups for failed validation its within the requirements of the assignment.

### Assignment 4AB
This assignment introduces arrays, properties (auto-implemented properties are disallowed), images and list boxes in windows forms. The application being built in the assignment is a recipe manager where the user may add recipes to a recipe list. Ingredients and recipes are being stored in arrays.

### Assignment 5AB
This assignment introduces constructor chaining and Lists, additionally the reading material touches on better encapsulation and OOP. The application built this time is a customer registry that stores customer contact details. All in all this assignment feels much like repetition of assignment 4AB but with the introduction of lists and constructor chaining.

### Assignment 6ABC
This assignment has by far been the most interesting one yet. While building upon the foundations previously established in assignment 4 and 5 it also adds a lot of new concepts. Tooltips, Timers, Assembly information, Resources and lastly reading and writing to files, in this case .txt files. The application built in this assignment is a task management/todo reminder app.
