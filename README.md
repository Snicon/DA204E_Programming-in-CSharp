# DA204E (Spring 25) - [Programming in C#](https://mau.se/en/study-education/course/da204e) @ [MAU](https://mau.se/en/)
This is an introductionary course to programming in C#. In this course we are learning C# with simple OOP principles and Windows Froms / GUI application development. The course consits of multiple assignements grouped into two groups as far as grading goes along with two quizzes graded together.

## Structure
This repo contains all the assignments I've worked on along with a some smaller optional projects on the side. Each assignment is in its own folder.


## About assignments

### Assignment 1 (A1A, A1B) - Exploring classes
Basically just some very simple OOP building our first classes and using encapsulation as a concept. Just some small terminal applications, nothing special really.

### Assignment 2 (A2A, A2B, A2C, A2D) - Loops, string formatting and basic calculation
Assignment two involves four parts: A2A - CostCalculator, A2B - NumberGame, A2C - StringFunctions / TemperatureConverter, A2D - Scheduler.
During all the parts of the assignments I've been tasked to validate input and use loops to let the user rerun the program without having to start it again. Additionaly I've worked with formatting strings.

#### A2A
Calculates discounts based on the amount of units the user decides to buy.

#### A2B
Lets the user guess a number. There are multiple difficulties which limit the amount of guesses the user can make.

#### A2C
Consits of using some very simple built-in methods for strings like ToUpper(). It also consits of a temperature converter than prints out a conversion table in a neat format.

#### A2D
More or less the same as A2C but withiout the conversion calculation, I use a for loop and some very basic math to determine which weeks the user is working.
